# DarkYoung
Interactive fiction horror game

Dark Young is an interactive fiction style horror game, written in java, meant to be played from the command line.  However, it is designed with change in mind, and may eventually be adapted for a more vision formatt. 

As a Java project, there will be many actual source code files.  The general purpose and description of each class file is listed in the project planning file. This file also outlines the goals of each version.   A seperate file for each verion of the code will be created to reitterate the goals of the version, and outline what actually needs to be done to accomplish those goals.  Commits are tagged as what version of the code they are.
