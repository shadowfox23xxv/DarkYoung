Dark Young - an interactive fiction horror game
Version 0.1 

Goals: Version 0.1 is the baseline setup for all future development.  A main, Interface, and Script class should be added.  With these limited classes, all the program will be able to accomplish is displaying a splash or introductory screen.  To do this, the following must be implemented:

-Create main, interface and script class files
-Main: instantiate an object of the Interface and Script classes.  Invoke Interface objects splash screen method
-Interface: Define splash screen method to print Script object strings
Script: Define strings to be printed for splash screen.  Should be only be accessible by interface class
